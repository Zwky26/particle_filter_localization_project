* Names: David Wu, Zack Wang

* How you will initialize your particle cloud (initialize_particle_cloud)?

* How you will update the position of the particles will be updated based on the movements of the robot (update_particles_with_motion_model)?
* How you will compute the importance weights of each particle after receiving the robot's laser scan data?(update_particle_weights_with_measurement_model)?
* How you will normalize the particles' importance weights (normalize_particles) and resample the particles (resample_particles)?
* How you will update the estimated pose of the robot (update_estimated_robot_pose)?
* How you will incorporate noise into your particle filter localization?
* A brief timeline sketching out when you would like to have accomplished each of the components listed above.
